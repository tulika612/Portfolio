    "about": "A bit about myself: \n\nMy name is Tulika Awalgaonkar and I have recently graduated from UCI with a Master's in Computer Science. I am interested in discovering and proposing the fundamental principles, algorithms, and implementations for solving software development-related problems. Over the past years, I have worked on several projects in the Android, web, and machine learning domains. I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at VMware in their vSphere Bitfusion team. I was working on analyzing Bitfusion performance for different ML benchmark usage scenarios, architecture, and AI frameworks. Currently, I am working at a Stealth startup, which is working on redefining software using generative AI. I worked on moving their current system to serverless using Azure functions and adding a caching layer to their backend.",
