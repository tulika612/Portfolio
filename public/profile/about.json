    "about": "A bit about myself: \n\nMy name is Tulika Awalgaonkar and currently, I am pursuing a Master of Computer Science from UCI, expected to graduate by December 2022. I am interested in discovering and proposing the fundamental principles, algorithms, and implementations for solving software development-related problems. Over the past years, I have worked on several projects in android, web, and machine learning domains. This has helped to strengthen my understanding of computer science fundamentals. Recently I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at VMware in their vSphere Bitfusion team. I was working on analyzing Bitfusion performance for different ML benchmark usage scenarios, architecture, and AI frameworks. Additionally, I also designed software to parse the output for various benchmarks and compare their performance on wavefront for different device and network configurations. Iâ€™m looking for SWE opportunities to gain further exposure to new tech stacks and tools to enhance my engineering skills.",
